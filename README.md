# Kill the red king!!!    ![Build status badge](https://github.com/valenplayer3000/kill-the-red-king-cube-alpha/workflows/MakeCode/badge.svg)

## Hi!

So this is a game that you need to kill the red king. 
Ez, right? Well this game is really hard, first the king has the same exact size as yourself (the white cube), second, the boss / king has 100 hp (like yourself) and third, you have an infinite supply of rockets (that means that you can spam the rockets).


## FAQ

**How do i install the game?**

First you need to have one of the suported devices listed on www.sites.google.com/view/pineappledev/proyects/depression-in-a-nutshell and you need to follow the instuctions on https://sites.google.com/view/pineappledev/support#h.re7av0iiw779


**The game is on pc?**
Not for now, because the engine i am using only supports PXT/Arcade Based devices. But i need help for porting the game to unity2D and make an standalone game for Mac, Windows and Linux.


**Where do i buy an PXT/Arcade device?**

You can buy one on amazon or ebay. (Not now because the pandemic thingy is making some trobule here...)
